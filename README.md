# task03_04
Third and fourth tasks in **[EPAM BelSUT Training](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training)**.

This task is based on [task01](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task01). I learned to create my personal exceptions. Also I did serialize java-object into file and reading information from this file back to java-object. I created documentation comments and generated a [javadoc](https://sharibo-epam-belsut-training.github.io/task03_04/). In the end I built a [jar-file](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task03_04/releases).
